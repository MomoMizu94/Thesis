Thesis prototype on NFT implementation to games
============================

This is a game project which implements NFTs to video games and demonstrates how blockchain technology (smart contracts, NFTs) could be used in games. This project contains a raw frame of a collectible card game and some of its core functionalities (card minting, trading) are executed on Ethereum blockchain. This project does not contain a proper game loop as it was used to demonstrate blockchain functionality. The video below serves as a short demonstration to the prototype.
